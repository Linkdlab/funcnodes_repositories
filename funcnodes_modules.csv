funcnodes-pandas,0.2.7,"# funcnodes-pandas\n\n`funcnodes-pandas` is an extension for the [Funcnodes](https://github.com/linkdlab/funcnodes) framework that allows you to manipulate [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames and Series using **FuncNodes**' visual node-based system. It provides a collection of nodes for performing typical operations on Pandas data structures, such as conversions, data manipulations, and calculations.\n\nThis library enables **no-code** and **low-code** workflows for **Pandas** by providing drag-and-drop functionality in a visual interface. It also supports Python-based scripting to handle more complex operations.\n\n## Features\n\n- **DataFrame Conversion**:\n  - Convert DataFrames to dictionaries and vice versa.\n  - Handle CSV and Excel files easily using DataFrame nodes.\n- **Data Manipulation**:\n\n  - Add, drop, and manipulate rows and columns of a DataFrame.\n  - Handle missing data with nodes for `fillna`, `dropna`, `ffill`, and `bfill`.\n  - Perform merges and joins with intuitive nodes for `merge`, `concatenate`, and `join`.\n\n- **Math & Statistical Operations**:\n\n  - Perform descriptive statistics like `mean`, `sum`, `std`, `var`, and `corr`.\n  - Evaluate custom expressions directly on DataFrames using the `eval` node.\n\n- **Masking & Filtering**:\n\n  - Apply masks to filter DataFrame data.\n  - Use conditions to filter rows and columns dynamically.\n\n- **Grouping & Aggregation**:\n\n  - Group data using `groupby` and aggregate it with `sum`, `mean`, `count`, etc.\n  - Easily convert groups into lists of DataFrames.\n\n- **Series Support**:\n  - Nodes for converting Series to lists and dictionaries.\n  - Access individual elements using `iloc` and `loc`.\n  - Perform string operations on Series.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the package with:\n\n```bash\npip install funcnodes-pandas\n```\n\nEnsure that you have **Pandas** and **FuncNodes** installed.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nHere's an overview of the basic programmatically usage of **funcnodes-pandas**.\n\n1. **Convert a DataFrame to a Dictionary**\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport funcnodes_pandas as fnpd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({""A"": [1, 2, 3], ""B"": [4, 5, 6]})\nnode = fnpd.to_dict()\nnode.inputs['df'].value = df\nawait node\nprint(node.outputs['dict'].value)\n```\n\nThis code converts a DataFrame to a dictionary using the `to_dict` node.\n\n2. **Filling Missing Data**\n\n```python\nnode = fnpd.fillna()\nnode.inputs[""df""].value = df\nnode.inputs[""value""].value = 0\nawait node\nprint(node.outputs[""out""].value)\n```\n\nThe `fillna` node fills missing data in a DataFrame.\n\n3. **Group By Operations**\n\n```python\nnode = fnpd.group_by()\nnode.inputs[""df""].value = df\nnode.inputs[""by""].value = ""A""\nawait node\nprint(node.outputs[""grouped""].value)\n```\n\nThis groups data based on column `A` in the DataFrame.\n\n## Testing\n\nThe repository contains a suite of tests to ensure that the various functionalities of `funcnodes-pandas` work as expected. The tests are based on **unittest** and **IsolatedAsyncioTestCase**. You can run the tests using:\n\n```bash\npython -m unittest discover\n```\n\nTest cases for operations such as `groupby`, `add_column`, `dropna`, etc., are included.\n\n## Contribution\n\nFeel free to contribute to this project by submitting pull requests.
